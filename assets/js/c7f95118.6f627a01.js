Numerous barriers hinder the reduction of health risks associated with extreme heat exposure. In response, the\xa0Heat and Health Research Incubator\xa0at The University of Sydney, in collaboration with community partners, developed the\xa0HeatWatch application. The HeatWatch application allows users to estimate a personalised heat health risk. It also provides science-backed cooling strategies that are easily implementable. Its design and features are shaped by direct consultations with community members via focus groups, ensuring a user-friendly and practical tool for heatwave health risk management.","permalink":"/docs/my-projects/heatwatch"},{"id":"my-projects/jsthermalcomfort","title":"jsthermalcomfort","description":"A JavaScript Solution for Thermophysiological Modelling","permalink":"/docs/my-projects/jsthermalcomfort"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
