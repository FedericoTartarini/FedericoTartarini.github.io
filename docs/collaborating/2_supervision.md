# Federico Tartarini - Supervision

:::info

This page is an instruction manual for working with me as your supervisor.

:::

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My supervision style

I regard supervision as a collaborative process that involves mutual respect, trust, and open communication. 
I aim to provide guidance, support, and constructive feedback to help you achieve your research goals and develop your skills. 
I believe in fostering a positive and inclusive research environment where everyone feels valued and supported.
I encourage you to take ownership of your research project and to be proactive in seeking help when needed.

## üìÖ Regular meetings

I will schedule regular meetings with you to discuss your research progress, challenges, and goals.
I expect you to come prepared for these meetings by setting an agenda and updating me on your progress.
I encourage you to ask questions, seek feedback, and share your ideas during these meetings.
I am open to adjusting the frequency and format of our meetings based on your needs and preferences.
You may also request additional meetings if needed.

Very important: 
* I expect you to be punctual and respectful of our meeting times. If you are unable to attend a meeting, please inform me in advance.
* Reply to my calendar invitation for any scheduled meetings.
* If you need to reschedule a meeting, please provide at least 24 hours' notice.
* Please be prepared to discuss your research progress, challenges, and goals during our meetings.
* Please share with me any updates before the meeting so that we can make the most of our time together.

## üìù Progress reports

I expect you to provide regular progress reports on your research activities, including any challenges you are facing and how you plan to address them.
Please share your progress reports with me at least 24 hours before our scheduled meetings so that I can review them in advance.
I encourage you to be honest and transparent in your reports, highlighting both your successes and challenges.
If you need additional support or resources to overcome any obstacles, please let me know so that we can address them together.

Tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), or [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) can be helpful for sharing progress reports and collaborating on documents.

## üìö Research goals

I will work with you to define clear research goals and milestones for your project.
I expect you to actively participate in setting these goals and to provide input on how best to achieve them.
I encourage you to be ambitious in your research goals while also being realistic about what can be accomplished within the given timeframe.

## üìß Communication

I prefer to communicate via email for non-urgent matters and to use scheduled meetings for more in-depth discussions.
Please use clear and concise language in your emails and provide context for any questions or requests.
I aim to respond to emails within 24 hours, but if your query is urgent, please let me know in the subject line.
If you have multiple questions or requests, please use bullet points to make it easier for me to address each one.
Please also refer to my [communication preferences](/docs/collaborating/how_to_work_with_me#%EF%B8%8F-communicating-with-me) for more details on how to communicate with me effectively.

## üìñ Resources

The University of Sydney offers a range of resources and support services for research students, including workshops, seminars, and online resources.
I encourage you to take advantage of these resources to enhance your research skills and knowledge.
If you need assistance in finding specific resources or support services, please let me know, and I will do my best to help you.

## üìù Feedback

I value feedback as an essential part of the supervisory process and encourage you to provide feedback on my supervision style and support.
I am open to constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement and will work with you to address any concerns you may have.
Please refer to my [feedback preferences](/docs/collaborating/how_to_work_with_me#%EF%B8%8F-from-you-to-me) for more details on how to provide feedback effectively.
