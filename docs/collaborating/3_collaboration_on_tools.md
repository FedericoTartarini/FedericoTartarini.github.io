# Federico Tartarini - How to collaborate with me on GitHub

This page is an instruction manual for collaborating with me on GitHub.

## üèÑ How I collaborate on GitHub

I am a strong advocate for using GitHub as a collaboration platform for research projects.
GitHub provides a range of tools and features that can help streamline the research process and enhance collaboration among team members.
I believe that GitHub can be a powerful tool for version control, issue tracking, code review, and project management.
I am not a computer scientist so if you have any suggestions on how to improve our workflow, please let me know.

## How to contribute to a GitHub repository

If you are new to GitHub or need a refresher on how to contribute to a repository, here are some basic steps to get you started:

# First Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line you can use a GUI client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)._

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="img/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.

This will create a copy of this repository in your account.


## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/img/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Open a terminal and run the following git command:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git clone "url you just copied")

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (where "url you just copied" &#40;without the quotation marks&#41; is the url to this repository &#40;your fork of this project&#41;. See the previous steps to obtain the url.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (For example:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Create a branch)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Change to the repository directory on your computer &#40;if you are not already there&#41;:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (cd first-contributions)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git switch -c your-new-branch-name)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (For example:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git switch -c add-alonzo-church)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Make necessary changes and commit those changes)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git add Contributors.md)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list")

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (replacing `your-name` with your name.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Push changes to GitHub)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Push your changes using the command `git push`:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (git push -u origin your-branch-name)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.)
