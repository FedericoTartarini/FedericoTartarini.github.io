#### **Whatâ€™s New in pythermalcomfort v3.0?**
Version 3.0 is a major leap forward, packed with new features and improvements:

1. **Structured Results with Dataclasses**  
   Functions now return dataclass instances, making it easier to access and organize results. For example:
   ```python
   from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso
   result = pmv_ppd_iso(tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model='7730-2005')
   print(result.pmv)
   print(result.ppd)
   ```  
   This change enhances readability and usability, especially when working with multiple outputs.

2. **Updated Function Names and Organization**
    - PMV functions are now named consistently (e.g., `pmv_ppd_ashrae`, `pmv_ppd_iso`).
    - Psychrometric functions have been moved to `utilities.py` for better organization.

3. **Array as inputs**  
   All functions now accept arrays as inputs, enabling faster batch processing of multiple inputs.

4. **Enhanced Documentation and Testing**
    - More examples and detailed descriptions of models.
    - Added input validation to ensure inputs are within model applicability limits.

5. **New Features**
    - Added surveys to assess thermal comfort in the documentation.
    - Included a detailed section on clothing insulation.

#### **How to Get Started**
Using pythermalcomfort v3.0 is easier than ever. Hereâ€™s a simple example to calculate PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) using the ISO 7730 standard:

```python
from pythermalcomfort.models import pmv_ppd_iso

# Input parameters
result = pmv_ppd_iso(tdb=[22, 25], tr=25, vr=0.1, rh=50, met=1.4, clo=0.5, model='7730-2005')

# Access results
print("PMV:", result.pmv)
print("PPD:", result.ppd)
```  

This example demonstrates how straightforward it is to perform thermal comfort calculations with pythermalcomfort.

#### **Upgrading from to v2.0 to v3.0?**
Please note that pythermalcomfort v3.0 introduces several breaking changes, including updated function names and structured results.
Hence, this upgrade may require adjustments to your existing codebase.

ðŸ‘‰ **Upgrade today and experience the future of thermal comfort calculations!**
