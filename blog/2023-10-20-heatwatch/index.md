At the Health and Health Research Incubator, together with our community partners, we are currently developing the HeatWatch, a web application that people in the community can use to calculate their personalised heat health risk. The application is free to use, you can access it via this [link](https://heatwatch.sydney.edu.au/). [Here is a 2-minute video](https://youtu.be/DjcMW1slwCw) about our project which summarises our aim and objectives, while [this is a 45-second version](https://youtu.be/liyCFwcNpGY) of the same video. Please feel free to share these links.

Over the 2023-2024 summer, we are planning to reach as many people as possible in the community by advertising the app on social media channels, news, and via our community partners’ networks and connections. The app not only allows people to calculate a personalised heat health risk but also provides detailed recommendations on how to implement low-cost and simple science-based effective cooling strategies.

While our application is free to use, some of the most vulnerable groups may not be able to access our application using a smartphone, hence, we are also planning to display the HeatWatch on public displays in community centres, libraries, police stations, etc. This will enable us to reach some of the most vulnerable groups. The public display version of the application can be accessed using this [link](https://heatwatch.sydney.edu.au/display).
