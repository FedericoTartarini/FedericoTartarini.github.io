At the [Heat and Health Research Incubator](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/heat-and-health-research-incubator.html) with [Ollie Jay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ollie-jay-793a1b11/) and our community partners, we are currently developing the HeatWatch, a web application that people in the community can use to calculate their personalised heat health risk. 
The application is free to use, you can access it via this [link](https://heatwatch.sydney.edu.au/).

A video I created about this project was awarded the "outstanding video" (first prize) in the [2023 Video Challenge from the journal Buildings & Cities](https://www.buildingsandcities.org/video-challenge/gallery-2023.html).

You can read more about the award on this [blog post](../2023-11-22-video-challenge/index.md).

Over the 2023-2024 summer, we are planning to reach as many people as possible in the community by advertising the app on social media channels, news, and via our community partnersâ€™ networks and connections. The app not only allows people to calculate a personalised heat health risk but also provides detailed recommendations on how to implement low-cost and simple science-based effective cooling strategies.

While our application is free to use, some of the most vulnerable groups may not be able to access our application using a smartphone, hence, we are also planning to display the HeatWatch on public displays in community centres, libraries, police stations, etc. This will enable us to reach some of the most vulnerable groups. The public display version of the application can be accessed using this [link](https://heatwatch.sydney.edu.au/display).

[Here is a 45-second video](https://youtu.be/liyCFwcNpGY) about our project which summarises our aim and objectives.
